## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- A MySQL database , I used pinecode
- Kinde account for authentication

- **Setup environment variables**

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project directory and fill it with your own values:

```plaintext
# Authentication
KINDE_CLIENT_ID=your_kinde_client_id
KINDE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_kinde_client_secret
KINDE_ISSUER_URL=https://your_kinde_project_name.kinde.com

```

- **Running the project**
  
After installation, you can start the project locally using npm command:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This command starts the developement server on `http://localhost:3000/`. Open your browser and navigate to this address to view the application.


## Deployment

Deploying your application can be done with various hosting services, but here we'll focus on deploying with [Vercel](https://vercel.com), the creators of Next.js. Vercel simplifies the deployment process and offers a seamless experience for Next.js applications.

### Steps for Deployment on Vercel:

1. **Sign Up/Login to Vercel**: First, create an account on Vercel if you don't already have one.

2. **Connect Your GitHub Repository**: Once logged in, you can connect your GitHub account and select the repository where your app resides.

3. **Configure Your Project**: After selecting your repository, Vercel will prompt you to configure your project. You should specify the build commands and output directory if they're not automatically detected. For a typical Next.js app, the default settings usually work out of the box.

4. **Environment Variables**: Input the necessary environment variables that your application requires (e.g., `KINDE_CLIENT_ID`, `KINDE_CLIENT_SECRET` , `KINDE_ISSUER_URL`, `KINDE_SITE_URL` , `KINDE_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL`, `KINDE_POST_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL`). Vercel allows you to set these securely in the project settings.

5. **Deploy**: With your project configured, you can proceed with the deployment. Vercel will build your application and provide a URL to access it live on the web.

6. **Continuous Deployment**: Any subsequent pushes to your repository (e.g., to the main branch) will trigger automatic deployments, ensuring your live application is always up to date.

For alternative deployment options and more detailed instructions, refer to the official [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment).
